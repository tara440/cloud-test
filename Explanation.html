<p> <strong>Explain Storage virtualization</strong></p>
Virtualization refers to the presentation of a simple file, logical volume or other storage object<br>
 to an application in such a way that allows the physical complexity of the storage to be hidden from <br>
 the storage administrator and the application. Today there are many kinds of virtualization such as Server <br>
 virtualization, Network Virtualization, Client and desktop virtualization, Services and Applications <br>
 Virtualization and Storage virtualization, in this project we are focus on storage virtualization.
    
	<p> <strong>Storage Virtualization</strong></p>
	This type of virtualization creates the abstraction of logical storage from physical storage, <br>
	so the user can access the integrated storage resources through unified logical interface of<br>
	this view. In a way using this technique, users do not have to be worried about the specific<br>
	location of their data, which can be identified using a logical path. Storage virtualization <br>
	grants us to harness a broad scope of storage facilities and represent them under a single <br>
	logical file system. There are various techniques for storage virtualization, one of the most <br>
	suitable being network-based virtualization by means of Storage Area Networks (SANs). SANs <br>
    use a network-accessible device in away large bandwidth connection to provide storage facilities.<br> 
	Generally, there are two type of Storage Virtualization
	
	<p> <strong>Block Level Storage Virtualization</strong></p>
	
	This type of storage virtualization is implemented in Storage Area Network, and it provides<br> 
	a translation layer in the SAN, between the hosts and the storage arrays.In the storage device<br> 
	the virtualization entity is map those virtual blocks to physical block, the storage capacity<br> 
   thatâ€™s made is accessible to operating system or application the example of it like Database. 

	<p> <strong>File level storage virtualization</strong></p>
	
	It is implemented Network Attach Storage level and help in solving NAS problems by removing<br>
	the dependencies between the data accessed at the file level and the location where the files<br>
	are physically stored, in this type of storage virtualization the virtual storage is provides<br>
	by virtualization entity is accessible to Operating System or applications in the form of file<br>
	and directories the example of it like NTFS file system in windows 2000 & NT.
